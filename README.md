# Sorting Visualizer Project

## Overview
The Sorting Visualizer is a Java-based graphical application that demonstrates how various sorting algorithms work visually. It provides a dynamic and interactive way
to learn about sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, and others by animating the sorting process.

---

## Features
- **Interactive GUI**: Built using Java Swing for a simple yet engaging interface.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Supports Bubble Sort and Selection Sort by default, with room to add more.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Animates the sorting process in real-time, showing comparisons and swaps.
- **Control Panel**: Includes buttons to start sorting, regenerate the array, and switch between algorithms.
- **Customizable Array**: Generates random arrays for sorting, allowing users to observe different scenarios.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.
4. The application window will launch, displaying the sorting visualizer.

## How to Use
1. **Generate Array**: Click the "Generate Array" button to create a new random array.
2. **Select Algorithm**: Choose an algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort) by clicking the respective button.
3. **Visualize Sorting**: Watch as the algorithm sorts the array step by step.
